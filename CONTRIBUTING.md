# Please read previous issues and Ougi's helpEmbed from help command to make sure you're not duplicating an existing issue or feature.

If you're suggesting or creating a feature, try to understand how Ougi works, here's some information:

  **Commands and functions**
  
   These are stored inside function folder, which contains a file called processCommand.js that handles everything that is sent as input.
   
  **Knowledge storage**
  
   The judgementAbility module and some other functions require knowledge storage files to work, those files are downloaded from Ougi's database at startup.
    
  **Is it useful?**
  
   Be mindful on how this feature will enhance user experience.
